Linked List with Generics
Bloom filters (membership check for very large numbers)
Distributed LRU cache



----
class problems
----
detect a loop in linked list
how many nodes in a loop
where does the loop start
LRU cache
min stack
Level order iterator of a heiarchical structure  (Node, right_ptr, down_ptr) so order will be left -> right first then top -> bottom (flatten/unflatten a list)
search in sorted linked list (better search than O(n))
Skip Lists





----
remaining
----
max in sliding window (homework1)
median of sorted circular array (problem statement is confusing) (test-2)
implement a queue using two stacks (test-3)
binary search sorted linked list ? is this even possible ? (class problem)
